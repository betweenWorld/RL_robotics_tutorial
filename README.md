# pytorch Robotics with RL tutorial

This project is for tutorial of robotics with reinforcement learning.
It includes examples of CartPole of Gym and Reacher of Mujoco controlled by RL.

* CartPole (OpenAI Gym)

CartPole implementation is based on the official tutorial code of pytorch[CartPole DQN](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html),
and some parts of the code are modified to simplify the problem.
While the original code learns from images, ours learns from simple state such like positions and velocities of CartPole.

* Reacher (Mujoco)

Mujoco simulator should be installed to run the Reacher example. It is not for free, but you can freely use it for a month.
You can get free one-year license if you are a student and have a school e-mail(ac.kr).
